# Claude.md Token Reduction Project Overview

## Purpose
A clean, secure implementation for reducing Claude.md token overhead while maintaining functionality. The project aims to implement a token-efficient Claude.md system that:
- Reduces token consumption by 50-70%
- Maintains full functionality and security
- Implements proper modular design
- Follows security best practices from Day 1

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Core Dependencies**: pyyaml, pathlib2, typing-extensions
- **Security**: cryptography, validators
- **Testing**: pytest, pytest-cov, pytest-mock
- **Code Quality**: flake8, black, mypy
- **Development**: pre-commit
- **Utilities**: click, colorama, tqdm

## Architecture
The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Phase 1A: Foundation (Day 1-3)
- Secure configuration management
- Modular file structure analysis
- Basic tokenization utilities
- Security framework initialization

### Phase 1B: Core Implementation (Day 4-7)
- Token reduction algorithms
- File parsing and processing
- Dynamic content loading
- Integration testing
