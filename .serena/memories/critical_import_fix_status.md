# Critical Import Fix Status - Phase 1C Blocking Issue

## Problem
- `src/__init__.py` has import error: `from .ai.smart_analysis_engine import SmartAnalysisEngine`
- SmartAnalysisEngine is actually located in `src/core/tokenizer.py` 
- This causes complete test suite failure (0/46 tests can run)

## Fix Attempts
- Tried using Serena replace_symbol_body to fix import
- File became corrupted/malformed with duplicate content during edits
- Need to completely rewrite src/__init__.py with clean structure

## Required Clean File Content
```python
"""
Claude.md Token Reduction Project

A secure, clean implementation for reducing Claude.md token overhead.
"""

__version__ = "0.1.0"
__author__ = "Takashi Yamashiro"
__email__ = "takashi@example.com"

# Version info
VERSION_INFO = (0, 1, 0)

# AI module components - FIXED import path
from .core.tokenizer import SmartAnalysisEngine

__all__ = [
    'SmartAnalysisEngine',
    '__version__',
    '__author__',
    '__email__',
    'VERSION_INFO'
]
```

## Status
- CRITICAL: File is currently malformed and needs complete rewrite
- QualityGate blocked at 78/100 until this is resolved
- Prevents Phase 1C progression
