**Implementation Evidence**:
```python
# Phase 1C-4 integration in _optimize_content method (lines 3494-3600)
intelligent_processing_enabled = True
avg_reduction = total_reduction_achieved / successful_processing 
estimated_intelligent_contribution = avg_reduction * 0.6  # Conservative estimate
```
