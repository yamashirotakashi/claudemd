# src/__init__.py Complete Replacement Required

## Issue Analysis
- File is corrupted and cannot be edited via Serena symbol replacement
- Need complete file replacement with clean content
- SmartAnalysisEngine confirmed exists in src/core/tokenizer.py at lines 57-706

## Required Solution
File needs to be completely replaced outside of Serena tools, then validated with:
1. Test suite run to confirm import works
2. QualityGate re-evaluation to verify 78/100 â†’ passing score
3. Phase 1C progression enablement

## Clean File Structure Required
```python
"""
Claude.md Token Reduction Project

A secure, clean implementation for reducing Claude.md token overhead.
