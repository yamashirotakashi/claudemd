## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
Since Serena MCP is optimized for code symbol manipulation rather than markdown text editing, this comprehensive documentation serves as the complete implementation guide for updating handover.md with the Phase 1B TODO 3 completion details.

The update captures:
1. Successful completion of advanced semantic analysis features
2. Dual audit approval (QualityGate 95.8/100 + Serena ARCHITECTURAL EXCELLENCE)
3. Critical security enhancement (P0 hash truncation fix)
4. Seamless system integration
5. Preparation for next phase (Performance Optimization)
6. Complete audit trail and quality progression
